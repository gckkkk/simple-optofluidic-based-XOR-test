# simple-optofluidic-based-XOR-test
'XOR_test.mlx' is the code containing everything from phase extraction to XOR training & testing
Other two files are small functions for the main code.

Raw ptw data is too big to upload, so attached 'phase5010_low.mat', 
which is the phase extracted from previous two steps, 
so please drectly start from %%% talior phase vs time data %%% part
